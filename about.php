                        <p class="mb-4">Who said paintings are best understood by art connoisseurs? As you scroll through our various collections, we bet you'll find an artwork that speaks to your soul. You'll know you've found 'the one' when you lose yourself in it and discover something new about your own self.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">The word 'Bimba' (pronounced "Bimbh") literally translates to 'image' and we believe every piece of art is a reflection of the artist's mind. Founded in 2020, we set out with a goal to make the world of art more fun and accessible, moving away from art galleries and exhibitions, and placing it all at your fingertips.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">We wish to bridge the gap between artists and buyers by creating an online platform where art from across the world finds a distinct voice and space. Artistic expression has no bounds at The Bimba. Be it our handpicked collections or blogs that bring stories from the world of art, we aim to be a one-stop-shop for all your art needs.</p>
                        <p>From the folk art of Pattachitra and Gond, to high quality Giclee prints of Van Gogh and Edvard Munch, our collections are curated with a lot of love and care. Our artisans carry forward their skill and legacy with each piece, hoping to secure a special spot in your heart and home!</p>
